# SbtBuiltError
Simple project to show how the GenBCode option breaks sbt rebuilds.

Basically if you have GenBCode enabled in a multi-project build and you do a compile-clean-compile cycle it breaks saying that it can't find certain class files.  If you quit sbt and restart then it compiles just fine until the next time you run a clean comand.

To reproduce follow these simple steps:

```
sbt
compile
clean
compile
```

You can find detailed debug logs on my machine [this debug file](./debug_errors.md).

Here is an example of the normal error output I see:
